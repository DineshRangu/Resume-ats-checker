# Resume-ats-checker
A Flask-based web application that extracts text from PDF resumes, uses KeyBERT to generate keywords, and compares them with job descriptions to calculate an ATS (Applicant Tracking System) score. The app highlights matched and missing keywords, helping job seekers optimize their resumes for better chances of passing ATS filters.
